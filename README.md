This project was undertaken as final year project during graduation.
It was designed for the hostels of my college,where there were different hostels for different year studenst.
Not only this ,the criteria for allotment of rooms was also different for each year.
This project also had modules for mess and warden.
Mess module allowed mess managers to calculate mess fees and udate status of payment as and when required.
Warden acted as admin.They had the access to data of every student.
